##### 1) Deploy the RAG flow to an online managed endpoint

Open the **Multi-Round Q&A on Your Data** flow that you created in the previous exercise.

After opening the flow, follow the instructions:

1.	Have a prompt flow ready for deployment. If you don't have one, see how to build a prompt flow.
   
2.	Optional: Select Chat to test if the flow is working correctly. Testing your flow before deployment is recommended best practice.
   
3.	Select Deploy on the flow editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you receive an error like the one below stating "Out Of Quota - No enough cluster CPU quota", you can request a quota increaseor just reduce the `instance count` to 2 instead of 3 and try the deployment again.
