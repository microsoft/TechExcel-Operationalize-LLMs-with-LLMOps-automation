##### 1) Create a new feature branch

1. In order to do that, run the following bash script.

    ```bash
    cd llmops-project
    
    echo "> Creating a feature branch"
    git checkout -b feature-ABCD
    
    echo "> Pushing the development branch to the remote repository"
    git push origin feature-ABCD
    ```

2. Change something in your flow.

    In this step, make a change in the `entity_extraction` flow, such as renaming one of the nodes.

3. Update feature branch.

    In order to update the feature branch, run the following bash script.

    ```bash
    cd llmops-project
    git add .
    git commit -m "updating config"
    git push origin feature-ABCD
    ```

4. Create a Pull Request from the feature branch to the development branch.

    Go to the project repository on GitHub.com to create the pull request.
